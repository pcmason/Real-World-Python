# Real-World-Python
***MUST LOOK AT THIS IN CODE***
This is my solution code for the challenge problems for Real World Python A Hacker's Guide to Solving Problems with Code by Lee Vaughan. 
  Chapter 1 - Added challenge solutions that implemented:
      - Ensures that duplicate coordinates in the SA are not searched again (bayes_no_dup.py).
      - Runs 400 Monte Carlo Simulations for 1 method that plays the game always double searching the highest prob. location while another method searches based on the highest prob. for 2 locations search to determine which is better (bayes_monte_carlo.py). 
      - Added a probability of detection variable that tells users based on the SEP and the prior prob. what the expected probability of detection is for each 
        possible choice in the game (bayes_pod.py).
  Chapter 2 - Added programs that implemented:
      - Create a dispersion plot based on characters appearances throughout Doyles's Hounds of the Baskervilles. Cool way to visualize plot of a story 
        (houndDispersion.py & dispersion_plot.png).
      - Create heat map for each author based on their usage of semicolons compared to other punctuation marks. Another way to prove that Doyle is the author of 
        The Lost World (punctuationHeatmap.py & each author_heatmap.png). 
      - Change the output for the FreqDist plots to be the ratio of each frequency instead of the total count (fixingFreq.py). 
  Chapter 3 - Added programs that implemented:
      - Scrapes 20 IMDB movie summaries and creates a multiple choice game of guessing the movie title based on the word cloud of the IMDB summary       
        (game_night_cp.py)
      - Uses Gensim library to summarize what some would already consider to be summaries. For this, specifically summarizes the Gensim Wikipedia page.     
        (summarizing_summaries_cp.py)
      - Summarizes each chapter of Doyle's 'The Hounds of the Baskervilles''. (summarize_hounds_cp.py).
      - Same program as bed_summary, but keeps the original order of the most important sentences instead of sorting by most important when outputting summary. 
        (not_what_said_how_said_cp.py)
  Chapter 4 - Added programs that implementd:
      -

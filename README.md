# Real-World-Python
This is my solution code for the challenge problems for Real World Python A Hacker's Guide to Solving Problems with Code by Lee Vaughan. 
  Chapter 1 - Added challenge solutions that implemented:
      - Ensures that duplicate coordinates in the SA are not searched again (bayes_no_dup.py).
      - Runs 400 Monte Carlo Simulations for 1 method that plays the game always double searching the highest prob. location while another method searches based on the highest prob. for 2 locations search to determine which is better (bayes_monte_carlo.py). 
      - Added a probability of detection variable that tells users based on the SEP and the prior prob. what the expected probability of detection is for each possible choice in the game (bayes_pod.py).
  Chapter 2 - Added programs that implemented:
      - Create a dispersion plot based on characters appearances throughout Doyles's Hounds of the Baskervilles. Cool way to visualize plot of a story (houndDispersion.py & dispersion_plot.png).
      - Create heat map for each author based on their usage of semicolons compared to other punctuation marks. Another way to prove that Doyle is the author of The Lost World (punctuationHeatmap.py & each author_heatmap.png). 
      - Change the output for the FreqDist plots to be the ratio of each frequency instead of the total count (fixingFreq.py). 
  Chapter 3 = Added programs that implemented:

# Real-World-Python
This is my solution code for the challenge problems for Real World Python A Hacker's Guide to Solving Problems with Code by Lee Vaughan. 
  Chapter 1 - Added challenge solutions that implemented:
      - Ensures that duplicate coordinates in the SA are not searched again (bayes_no_dup.py).
      - Runs 400 Monte Carlo Simulations for 1 method that plays the game always double searching the highest prob. location while another method searches                   based on the highest prob. for 2 locations search to determine which is better (bayes_monte_carlo.py). 
      - Added a probability of detection variable that tells users based on the SEP and the prior prob. what the expected probability of detection is for                    each possible choice in the game (bayes_pod.py).
